msgctxt "Addon Description"
msgid "MilkDrop was originally a music visualiser \"plug-in\" to the Winamp music player. As you listen to your music, MilkDrop takes you flying through the actual soundwaves you're hearing, and uses beat detection to trigger myriad psychedelic effects, creating a rich visual journey through sound."
msgstr "MilkDrop は元々 Winamp 音楽プレーヤーのビジュアライザープラグインでした。音楽を再生すると、音楽にあわせた波の上を飛んでいるような視覚効果が現れ、ビート検出により無数のサイケデリックな効果が生まれ、音による視覚的体験を生み出します。"

#[Consistency] Make terms, settings names, brands and other minutiae, consistent throughout file.
#[Capitalization] Avoid capitalizing every second word. See http://grammarist.com/capitalization/
#For example, prefer wording as "This new string" instead of "This New String".
#[Referencing] If a suitable string already exists, reuse it, making a note of where it's used!
#[Description / location] For example, "#. Description of some setting" used on "#: xbmc/addons/guidialogaddoninfo.cpp"
#When writing a description or setting, refer to a setting name in quotes. See existing entries for guidance.
#For example, "Press \"OK\" for \"All seasons\"" instead of "Press OK for All seasons" after first word.
