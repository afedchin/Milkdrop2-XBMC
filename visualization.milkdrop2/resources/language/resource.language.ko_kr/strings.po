msgctxt "Addon Description"
msgid "MilkDrop was originally a music visualiser \"plug-in\" to the Winamp music player. As you listen to your music, MilkDrop takes you flying through the actual soundwaves you're hearing, and uses beat detection to trigger myriad psychedelic effects, creating a rich visual journey through sound."
msgstr "MilkDrop는 원래 윈앰프의 음악 시각화 플러그인입니다. 음악을 들으면서 사운드 웨이브로 날아가는듯한 효과를 보여주며 비트 감지를 해서 다양한 싸이키데릭한 효과를 만들어 풍부한 시각적 경험을 하게합니다."

#[Consistency] Make terms, settings names, brands and other minutiae, consistent throughout file.
#[Capitalization] Avoid capitalizing every second word. See http://grammarist.com/capitalization/
#For example, prefer wording as "This new string" instead of "This New String".
#[Referencing] If a suitable string already exists, reuse it, making a note of where it's used!
#[Description / location] For example, "#. Description of some setting" used on "#: xbmc/addons/guidialogaddoninfo.cpp"
#When writing a description or setting, refer to a setting name in quotes. See existing entries for guidance.
#For example, "Press \"OK\" for \"All seasons\"" instead of "Press OK for All seasons" after first word.
